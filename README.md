# Miryoku_CMS
Its my take on Miryoku layout for a corne 3x6 + 3 with french-canadian character in mind on QMK

I don't own in any form the Miryoku layout, its just my take on it

The layout is model with CMS (canadian multilingual standart) in the OS keyboard setting

It mimic almost entirely the miryoku layout with some difference

the media layer is change cause I don't need it, instead it have a french character layout

the code and number layout are slightly change to adapt to the CMS change from US. It has some difference thought. 
Just check the custom_config for all the change

you need (https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_qmk/tree/miryoku/users/manna-harbour_miryoku) and change the custom_config.h by this one and you're good to go :)
